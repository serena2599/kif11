#A posttranslational modification of the mitotic kinesin Eg5 that enhances its mechanochemical coupling and alters its mitotic function

## Abstract 
We investigated one of these—acetylation of lysine 146 in Eg5—by creating an acetylation mimetic lysine to glutamine substitution (K146Q).Eg5的转录后修饰

Lysine 146 is located in the α2 helix of the motor domain, where it makes an ionic bond with aspartate 91 on the neighboring α1 helix.  

methods: structural kinetics and singlemolecule mechanics

results: the K146Q mutation increases motor performance under load and coupling of the neck linker to catalytic site.

These changes convert Eg5 from a motor that dissociates from the microtubule at low load into one that is more tightly coupled and dissociation resistant -- features shared by kinesin 1.

the K146Q Eg5 acetylation mimetic should act in the cell as a “brake” that slows spindle pole separation.

## Introduction
individual kinesins can play multiple cellular roles.

MTs also play multiple roles in cell physiology, and this adaptability is due in part to multiple posttranslational modifications (PTMs) (7–9)

Multiple PTMs in the motor domain of the mitotic kinesin Eg5 have been reported (12), including in Loop 5 and helices α2and α3—all in the vicinity of the catalytic site (Fig. 1A).
